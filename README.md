# Programming: principle and practice using C++
My solutions to many exercises of the book: Programming principles and practice using C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup. Each exercise is done using almost only the techniques explained in the corresponding chapters. Some exercise solutions are provided by the author. In such cases I won't upload mine, or if I do, they will be very similar to the author's.

Please visit [Bjarne Stroustrup's website](https://www.stroustrup.com/ "Bjarne Stroustrup's Homepage") where you can find many interesting things like interviews, videos, and many info about C++, including the solutions to some exercise.
And on [Bjarne Stroustrup's Github](https://github.com/BjarneStroustrup) you can find the headers referenced in the book.

### Note: 
I didn't use the "std_lib_facilities.h" header, so far I have used the *fully qualified name*  (that is the : : notation) for the standard library but I will also use *using* directives. <br> Some exercises are very hard and hopefully I came up with the right solutions, but I am sure many of them can be refactored. <br> This is still an ongoing project as of April 2021.
